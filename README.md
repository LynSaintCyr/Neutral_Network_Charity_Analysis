# Neutral_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns

APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

USE_CASE—Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION—Organization type

STATUS—Active status

INCOME_AMT—Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application

ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

# Results

The IS_SUCCESSFUL column is considered the target for my model.

The APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, and ASK_AMT columns are considered to be the features of my model.

The EIN, and  NAME columns were removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features.
